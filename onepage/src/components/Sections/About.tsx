                <h2>Michelle, the Structured one</h2>
                <p>I'm a fullstack developer student at Medieinstitutet with a passion for building clean, functional websites that solve real problems. I enjoy turning ideas into streamlined, user-friendly web experiences â€” making sure both the frontend and backend work seamlessly together.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p className="baby">I approach each project with curiosity and a practical mindset. I like figuring out what makes a system run smoothly and how to design something that feels intuitive to use. Whether it's setting up a solid database or fine-tuning the details of a layout, I focus on building things that are both useful and lasting.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Collaboration is a big part of how I work. I listen, ask questions, and care about understanding your goals so I can help bring them to life in a way that makes sense for your business. If you're looking for someone thoughtful, reliable, and hands-on, I'm ready to jump in.</p>
